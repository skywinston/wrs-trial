        <h1>Your clients are cheating on you</h1>
        <p>
          Consumers are flocking to third party real estate sites like Zillow and Trulia.  They love the modern design, apps and rich information these sites deliver.  But what they don’t know is the data is stale and they are being used.  Give your clients the best of both worlds, fresh data from the MLS delivered in an elegant and delightful way.

            Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest all use streams as a way of viewing data.  Cloud Streams put photos front and center, to give your buyers a window shopping experience they will love.

          <p>
            Listing alerts sent from the MLS are boring.  Cloud Streams’ MLS listing alerts include property photos, agent branding and descriptive subject lines.  At a glance your buyer can make decisions without having to click anywhere else.

            How many properties do they like?  What the average price of those properties? How do I contact the listing agent?  Which clients are opening their email?  What clients are most active?  Are they changing their search criteria?  What are the showing instructions?
All in one place.
